### This folder contains programs that code known games and/or compute their probabilities

1. [FlipToWin](https://github.com/hector-barriga/Probability-Games/blob/main/Games/FlipToWin.ipynb): You start with 2 coins, and flip them. You get as many new coins as the number of tails you get, and you can flip again. At any turn, if you get all heads, the game stops.  
    Question. What is the probability that the game goes on forever?
