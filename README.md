# Probability Games
### This folder contains programs that code known games and/or compute their probabilities

1. [FlipToWin](https://github.com/hector-barriga/Probability-Games/blob/main/Games/FlipToWin.ipynb): You start with 2 coins, and flip them. You get as many new coins as the number of tails you get, and you can flip again. At any turn, if you get all heads, the game stops.  
    Question. What is the probability that the game goes on forever?
2. [Dice Game](https://github.com/hector-barriga/Probability-Games/blob/main/Games/Dice%20Game.ipynb): At the end of the Spring 2024 semester, one of my students asked about a probability game with a dice. This is the game:
    - You roll a different number of dice, but they’re all six sided.
    - If a dice roll a 1, 2 or 3 that dice is worth zero points, if you roll 4 or 5 it’s worth one point, and if you roll a 6 it’s worth two points.
   Question. What is the probabilty of getting 5 or more points?
